                  I don’t think this and even my gratitude journal entry can properly convey how thankful I am that you’re in my life. I continue to admire your kindness, care, and overall genuineness every day, and you truly are a support pillar for everyone. Thank you for being you, and I hope we can continue to celebrate more birthdays together and grow as well. Love you lots, happy birthday ❤️</p>
