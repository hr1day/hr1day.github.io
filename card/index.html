                You know that you are Mimi's life and Dida's half life😄
                Sorry for missing your birthday once again🎂. 
                We are happy that  you are celebrating this birthday with loved ones minus us😓. 
                You are an angel disguised as our daughter😇 
                We couldn't have asked for anything more than you as our baby. We miss you so much and your birthdays are a constant reminder that now you are not that small child under the umbrella anymore. But the greatest consolation is you are living your dream. You are our greatest support and hope we are to you.
                Wish you many many happy returns of the day. We wish you a very happy birthday. May God bless you with abundant health, wealth, peace, prosperity long life and everything you wish for
                🙌 
                Have a great day and a great life dearest baby. We love you immensely👶 👩‍🍼 ❤️</p>
                <p>Mimi and Dida</p>
